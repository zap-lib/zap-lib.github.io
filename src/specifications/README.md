# Specifications

Zap aims to support various programming languages and runtimes. Therefore, there is a need to provide a consistent interface across all implementations. This section defines the standard interfaces of Zap.

This specification defines a general interface for implementations and is not based on any specific programming language. Therefore, please refer to the API documentation of each implementation for details such as specific function names, property names, and parameters.

Among the interfaces presented in this specification, there are those that must be implemented, those that are recommended for implementation under specific circumstances, and optional ones. In such cases, keywords are used in accordance with the criteria suggested in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
